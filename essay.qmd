title: Celebrity Private Jet Data Analysis
jupyter: python3

### Julian Shah, Yunzhu Chen

## Introduction

This essay aims to see patterns in 'kind' of celebrity using a private
jet and their carbon foot print from their private jets. Many celebrities
have the means to travel extremely far, extremely fast because they can
afford to buy a private jet. However, we wanted to quantify the exact
impact to the environment this luxury creates and which kind (eg. actors,
businessnessmen, YUNZHU PLEASE FINISH ALL CATAGORIES) is the largest offendor
of private jet carbon emissions.

We used celebrities found on the leaderboard of [celebrityprivatejettracker.com](https://celebrityprivatejettracker.com/)

(In the introduction, you should aim to tell the reader what your
project is about. In doing so, you should answer the following
questions:

What is the question you are trying to answer or the story that you are
trying you tell? Why is this question or story important? What were the
main steps your project made towards answering the question or telling
the story? Beyond answering these questions, you are free to structure
this section however you wish.)

### Research Question and Background

### Overview of the Project

### Setup Instructions



```{python}
#| vscode: {languageId: plaintext}
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

## Methodology

This project is structured around data retrieved from 
[celebrityprivatejettracker.com](https://celebrityprivatejettracker.com/leadeerboard).
The leaderboard contains 63 celebrities (as of 03/27/2025) which we scrape
from the site usinng python


(In the methodology, you should explain how you obtained, processed, and
summarized or visualized the data. In doing so, you should answer the
following questions:

Where did you get your data from? How did you get this data (i.e., did
you programmatically download it or did you access it through an API)?
How did you store and/or process this data (e.g., did you store and
process it in Pandas)? What information did you get from this data that
you used in the presentation of your results?)

### Data Collection and Processing

Here is all the data we got and used in this project.

**1) Celebrity Jet Usage** **Source:** Celebrity Jet Tracker Website
(https://celebrityprivatejettracker.com/) **Method:** Scrap/html …?
**Process & Storage:** **Usage:**

**2) Celebrity Age and Occupation** **Source:** Wikipedia **Method:** We
got it directly from the Wikipedia website with several libraries,
including requests, wptools and mwparserfromhell. **Process & Storage:**
**Usage:**

**3) Celebrity Net Worth** **Source:** API Ninjas website **Method:**
**Process & Storage:** **Usage:**

**4) Oscar & Grammy Nominees** **Source:** Wikipedia **Method:** We got
it directly from the Wikipedia website with several libraries, including
requests, wptools and mwparserfromhell. **Process & Storage:**
**Usage:**

### Data Analysis and Visualization

How do we relate the data and use them

## Results

(In the results, you should show the main summaries or visualizations of
your data, along with any accompanying information. In doing so, you
should answer the following questions:

What summaries or visualizations did you create? What are the
interesting and/or important parts of these summaries or visualizations?
How do these results answer your questions or tell your story?)

### Visualizations

-   Pie chart of jet miles each owner
-   ??(some kind of graph) of carbon emissions rank of people who own
    more than one jet
-   Histogram of carbon emiisions by age
-   Histogram of carbon emissions by net worth

potentially: - Pie chart of carbon emiisions by occupation - Carbon
emission among musicians (grammy nominees vs others) - Carbon emission
among actors (oscar nominees vs others)

### Summaries and Interpretation

## Conclusion

(In the conclusion, you should provide key takeaways for the reader. In
doing so, you should answer the following questions, where applicable:

What are the important insights that the reader should get from this
project? What are the ethical considerations surrounding the data
sourcing? What are the contextual or ethical implications of your topic
or work? What lessons did you learn as you did the project? What were
the most difficult, challenging, or frustrating parts of the project? In
what ways would you extend or change your project if you had more time?)

### Ethical Considerations

### Challenges and Restrictions
